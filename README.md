# nopCommerce Robot Framework
# Saucedemo

## Project description
The primary aim of the nopCommerce project was to refine and implement automated testing methodologies using the Robot Framework and Browser Library. With nopCommerce as the testing platform, I developed test cases focusing on essential e-commerce functionalities such as product browsing, checkout processes, and user account management. The project repository contains detailed test data and configurations, demonstrating the effectiveness and thoroughness of the automated testing procedures applied to nopCommerce.
